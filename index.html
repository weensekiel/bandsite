          The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
          California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
          vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
          band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
          attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
          working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
          band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees
          Knees to sign with a well known record label.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
          ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell
          in love with the band&apos;s original and organic attitude,
          solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and
          coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves
          as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances
          on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio
          album, looking to be released in early 2024.
